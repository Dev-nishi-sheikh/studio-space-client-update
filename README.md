# StudioSpace — Peer-to-Peer Creative Studio Marketplace

**Live site:** [https://studio-space-client.vercel.app](https://studio-space-client.vercel.app)

StudioSpace is a peer-to-peer marketplace for photo studios, sound stages, podcast lounges, music suites and art workshops. Creators discover a room, check the details and live availability, then reserve it by the hour. Hosts list their spaces, manage listings and keep the booking calendar on their own terms.

> Built as the client-side application for Assignment 8. The app ships with a complete **demo mode** so every flow (auth, listings, bookings, wishlist) works before the Express/MongoDB API is connected.

## ✨ What you can do

- **Discover with a cinematic home page** — Swiper-powered hero slider, six dynamic featured studios fetched with a limit, five browsable categories, a four-step booking explainer and a host-guarantee section.
- **Search and filter the directory** — keyword search, category chips, price ceiling, sorting and URL-based category preselection, with branded skeleton loaders and a friendly empty state.
- **Book a real room in a modal** — pick a date and time window, see the hourly math and refundable deposit update live, and submit a reservation that starts as **Pending**.
- **Host your own space** — full add/edit forms with cover-image upload (imgbb when configured), gallery URLs, amenity checkboxes, live card preview and read-only host details.
- **Manage everything from a dashboard** — My Studio Listings with a delete confirmation modal, My Bookings with status badges, cancel flow and printable/PDF invoices for confirmed bookings.
- **Save a shortlist** — heart any studio card to add it to a MongoDB-backed wishlist (localStorage-backed in demo mode).
- **Work in light or dark** — persistent theme toggle covering every surface, illustration and print-friendly invoice.
- **Friendly failure states** — custom 404, route-level skeletons, toasts for every action, inline form validation and no browser `alert()` anywhere.

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript (strict) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, custom design tokens |
| UI primitives | Custom components, lucide-react |
| Slider | Swiper.js 14 |
| Notifications | Sonner |
| Theme | next-themes (class strategy) |
| Auth (client) | Auth context + HTTPOnly-cookie API calls; demo session fallback |
| Images | Unsplash + imgbb upload endpoint |
| API | Express + MongoDB (separate repository, see API contract below) |
| Deployment | Vercel (recommended) |

## 🚀 Run it locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment variables

```env
# Leave empty to use the built-in demo data (recommended for a quick look).
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=

# Optional — enables real image uploads through imgbb.
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMGBB_API_KEY=

# Optional — force demo mode even if an API URL exists.
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=
```

- **No `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** → demo mode. Seed listings, users, bookings and wishlists persist in `localStorage`, including double-booking prevention and password rules.
- **Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** (for example `http://localhost:5000/api`) → the app calls the Express/MongoDB server with `credentials: "include"` so JWTs travel in HTTPOnly cookies.

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔑 Examiner test credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host — owns 3 listings, has bookings | `harry@studiospace.com` | `Studio123` |
| Creator — has bookings and a wishlist | `mia@studiospace.com` | `Studio123` |

You can also press **Use host demo** on the login page to fill the form. The Google button simulates a Google session in demo mode and redirects to the real OAuth endpoint when an API URL is configured.

Registration is available at `/register`; passwords require an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter and at least 6 characters.

## 🔌 API contract (Express server)

The client calls these endpoints when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is present. All requests include cookies.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Set HTTPOnly JWT cookie |
| `POST` | `/auth/register` | Create account |
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | Current user |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Clear session |
| `GET` | `/auth/google` | Google OAuth entry point |
| `GET` | `/studios` | List/filter (`search`, `category`, `maxPrice`, `sort`, `featured`, `limit`) |
| `GET` | `/studios/:id` | Studio details |
| `GET` | `/studios/mine` | Listings owned by the signed-in user |
| `POST` | `/studios` | Create listing (protected, HTTPOnly cookie) |
| `PATCH` | `/studios/:id` | Update listing (protected) |
| `DELETE` | `/studios/:id` | Delete listing (protected) |

| `GET` | `/studios/:id/availability?date=` | Booked windows for a date |

The bundled demo implements the same behaviour locally, including the confirmed-booking overlap check used by Challenge 2.

## 🎨 Design notes

- Warm paper light theme and near-black cinema dark theme, with vermilion and acid-lime accents.
- Bricolage Grotesque for display type, Manrope for body copy; one consistent heading scale across every page.
- Equal-height studio cards, uniform 4:3 imagery, a shared pill button system and a sticky navbar with active-route indicators.
- Responsive from 320px upward: slide-out mobile navigation, horizontal snap galleries and stacking form sections.
- The X (formerly Twitter) logo is used in the footer alongside Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn.
- Print styles hide the site chrome and force the invoice to a clean white sheet.

## ☁️ Deployment

1. Push the client repository to GitHub.
2. Import it into Vercel.
3. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (your Render/Express API URL) if you have deployed the server. Leave it blank to run the demo.
4. Deploy, then update the **Live site** link at the top of this README.

Every route is safe to reload directly — dynamic studio and invoice pages are server-rendered on demand, and the 404 page handles unknown paths.
